the

but
I
can
tell
you
its
CRAZY
GOOD
Top
of
the
year
is
gonna
be
outrageousMyriamKeys
its
in
the
eyes
Its
all
of
the
above
But
no
one
really
knows
only
the
most
high
MyriamKeys
its
really
hard
Especially
on
team
P
cause
everyone
is
pretty
fantastic
But
yes
Its
instinct
its
feel
its
personalityMyCorinthian98
didnt
want
that
to
be
meMyCorinthian98
I
also
realized
that
most
negative
people
are
that
way
because
they
are
too
afraid
to
try
to
reach
their
own
dreams
andMyCorinthian98
defining
moment
for
me
was
the
realization
that
if
I
let
the
negativity
defeat
me
I
would
never
have
what
I
dreamed
ofdickc
I
like
FKAtwigs
right
now
Funny
enough
I
also
