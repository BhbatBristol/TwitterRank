human

If

society

tremendous
difficultiesHuman
rights
apply
to

youll
develop

acting

love
and
compassion
can
help
achieve
that
balanceI
believe
that
human
nature
is
fundamentally
positive

a

is
vital
that
when

we
do
not
neglect
to
educate
their
hearts
by
nurturing
their
compassionate
natureIf

If

people
trust
you
you
have
no
grounds
for

also
a
warm
heart
Then
a
